	<h3>About Me<hr></h3>
	<p>I am a model here in Sorsogon City and part of a model agency called <i>SORSOGON PAGEANT ACADEMY (S.P.A)</i><br>
		Being a part of this organization has boosted my confidence in myself, so it is a privilege for me to be a
	self-assurance as a result of which I also had the bravery to mingle with people.<br> Additionally,
	 we learn a lot more as a result of this agency because they instruct not just modeling but also a variety of other skills like:</p>
	 <ol>
		 <li>Posture & Presence</li>
		 <li>Proper Communication</li>
		 		<ul>
					<li>Organizational skills</li>
					<li>Listening skills</li>
			 </ul>
		 <li>Discipline</li>
		 <li>Professionalism</li>
	 </ol><br><br><br>
